# What Is ChatGPT Doing... and Why Does It Work?
### Book Review
**Author**: Stephen Wolfram
**Published**: 2023
**Genre**: Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning
**Introduction**

I've seen this book when I was visiting the LA for a business trip. The reason I chose this book is that The author, Stephen Wolfram, is a well-known entrepreneur and computer scientist, but I didn't know much about him before. I was curious to learn more about his work and insights into the field of artificial intelligence. Actually, his name was familiar to me because I've seen his name in the 'Wolfram Alpha' and 'Mathematica' when I was in the university. I took the course for using 'Wolfram Alpha' and 'Mathematica' from my professor when I was in GIST.
I've surprised that he wrote this book, and was contributed to the development of ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI.
So I've started reading the book "What Is ChatGPT Doing... and Why Does It Work?" by Stephen Wolfram. 
The book provides a deep dive into the workings of ChatGPT, an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. Wolfram, a renowned computer scientist and entrepreneur, explores the underlying principles of ChatGPT and its implications for the future of artificial intelligence.
The book is structured as a series of essays that cover various aspects of ChatGPT, including its architecture, training process, and the challenges it faces. Wolfram's writing is accessible and engaging, making complex concepts easy to understand for readers with varying levels of technical expertise.
I've learned that ChatGPT is based on a transformer architecture, which allows it to process and generate human-like text. The model is trained on vast amounts of data, enabling it to understand context and generate coherent responses. Wolfram also discusses the limitations of ChatGPT, such as its inability to reason or understand the world in the same way humans do.
The book emphasizes the importance of understanding the underlying principles of AI and machine learning, as these technologies continue to evolve and shape our world.
I've found the book to be a valuable resource for anyone interested in AI, machine learning, and the future of technology. Wolfram's insights into the workings of ChatGPT and its implications for society are thought-provoking and relevant.
The book also raises important questions about the ethical implications of AI and the need for responsible development and deployment of these technologies.
