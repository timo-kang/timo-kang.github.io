# The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win

### Book Review

**Authors**: Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford
**Published**: 2013
**Genre**: Business, Technology, Fiction

**Introduction**

I've started read this book, "The Phoenix Project," which my best firend 'Danny' recommended to me (Actcually he recommended another one 'Unicorn Project'). The book is a fictional narrative that explores the challenges and complexities of managing IT in a modern business environment. The main character, Bill Palmer, is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, a fictional automotive company. The story follows his journey as he navigates the challenges of a major project called "The Phoenix Project," which aims to transform the company's IT operations and improve its overall performance.
I'm really enjoying the book so far, and engaging with the characters and their struggles. it describes the challenges of managing IT in a fast-paced 'real-world' business environment, and the importance of collaboration, communication, and continuous improvement in achieving success of IT projects.
I've learned that the business descisions and IT decisions are closely intertwined, and that effective communication and collaboration between IT and business teams are essential for success. The book also emphasizes the importance of understanding the flow of work, feedback loops, and the need for a culture of continuous learning and improvement.
Also, I've experienced the difficulties of collaborating with different teams and departments (especially in the case of 'DevOps', which is hard to put apart from the 'Development' and 'Operation' teams).
If you're not working in the Big Tech companies, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in IT, DevOps, and organizational change.
There're so many hard decisions and challenges that IT managers face, and the book provides valuable insights into how to navigate these challenges and drive successful IT transformations.
